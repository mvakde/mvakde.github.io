> JEE is a tough exam written by a million students. There is a massive industry around tutoring students for this exam that pushes kids to study insanely hard.  

Here's an easier way.

---

### What I did
I cleared the JEE exam in an extremely unconventional manner. I skipped 2/3rds of the entire Chemistry syllabus. I also skipped a few topics in Math and Physics. I did not memorize a single formula (other than fundamental laws/principles) and I barely solved any practice questions. 

Also, I studied for only ~1 year, ran away from my boarding school/coaching centre and for the last 8 months before the exam, I stayed home binging Netflix and Wikipedia instead of going to school. 

My rank after all this - 1505 (general, no reservation). Pretty good for an exam written by a million people.

Now compare that to what most people who get ranks under 3000 do:
1. Study 10-14 hours a day, 7 days a week for 2-5 years
2. Memorise a massive list of formulae (> 5K) and facts
3. Solve an insane number of questions (10K-30K) to the point of memorising question types and their solutions
4. No social life, no fun, pure cramming

### Okay how?
The core difference in my approach is that I spent an *unreasonable* amount of time on conceptual understanding and zero time on rote memorisation.
- Understand the concepts deeply, and practice ~10 difficult questions per chapter. (That's all I did. This is enough for all of Physics, most of Maths and a third of chemistry.)
- To understand the concepts, I had a book where I broke down each and every concept. (I didn't know any formulae by heart, but I could derive every single one of them.)
- Skip the rest of the chapters. (I skipped all the memorisation heavy stuff - all of inorganic and organic chemistry, integral calculus, etc.)  

Now the best part. The hardest thing back then was not having anyone who could answer my doubts (most teachers do not understand the concepts at the depth I am talking about). But today you have LLMs that can. You don't have to scour discussion forums on the internet for every concept, or pirate and search through 10GB of undergrad/postgrad level books like I did. Fire up o4-mini-high or gemini-2.5-pro and you're sorted. 


### Warning
I must stress this - you need to obsess over understanding concepts at a depth you've never done before. A good metric is being able to derive all formulae from scratch and being able to intuitively understand college level concepts of the same topic. This still requires spending a lot of time studying but it is atleast an order of magnitude lesser than what is traditionally done - a few hours a day for about a year is enough. 

This strategy works if you want a ~600 or lower rank. (In my year, it would have been enough for ~300 rank. I made a bunch of silly mistakes that landed me 1500). However, if you want to get a rank below ~100, you'd have to take the "best of both worlds" approach. Memorise the rest of chemistry and solve a lot of questions for a few topics like integral calculus.  

If you choose the "best of both worlds" approach, be wary of how much rote memorisation you do. It makes you stupid. Solving a lot of problems sort of mitigates this by forcing you to think, but its still superficial thinking ("How do I manipulate this question so that it fits into this formula I memorised").

P.S.
This "blindly memorise everything and work insanely hard" mentality that the JEE coaching industry promotes is extremely harmful to you and society. It breeds rat-race loving prestige-chasers who often end up in roles that negatively affect society. It also squashes both your contrarian and critical thinking skills and leaves a mental toll that takes a long time to heal.


*Todo: Add some proofs so that people believe its actually doable. Maybe explain how to go deep with an example so its more clear? Also add a section explaining the context behind JEE for those who are unaware.*



<!-- 
This routine is unneccessary and takes a massive mental toll. 

I spent time understanding concepts 
This sort of routine is pushed onto students by the "JEE coaching" industry. They 
The worst part? Most of the teachers (ofc, exceptions exist) themselves have rote memorised facts and aren't strong in concepts.

See the appendix for the following: (ADD HYPERLINKS) Why am I writing this, proof of all my claims here.

## Why am I writing this?
(1) My experience with JEE is very unique, (2) the age of LLMs has makes my path much less riskier and (3) JEE is a great demonstration of Goodhart's law

## What is JEE? (APPENDIX)
This is the entrance examination for IITs (a group of the top engineering schools in India) and is colloqially considered one of the hardest high school examinations in the world. ~1.5 million kids write it every year, with only the top 10,000 qualifying.

## Misconceptions
Now that you know all the above, what can you infer?
| Myth | Fact |
|--|--|
| IIT grads are extremely intelligent | They have the skills required to pass competitive analytical examinations - the capability to work extremely hard and above average analytical skills |

I don't mean to shit on all my fellow IIT grads. Due to the competitive nature of the exam, those who pass generally are smarter than average, but not as much as society seems to believe. They do have 2 skills that are extremely valuable - the ability to work extremely hard and analytical problem solving skills.  



## What should an ideal replacement test for?
I assume the intent of JEE is to find the smartest/most capable students in India, and reward them with a great education so that they can contribute positively to the country. With this goal in mind, I don't think much needs to be changed about JEE since imo intelligence is overrated and hardworkers better contribute to society. , but But JEE is no longer is a good measure of smartness/capability because of this $3B coaching industry that now revolves it. It is a great demonstration of Goodhart's law:
> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

Not everything needs to be changed though. I think intelligence is overrated and an exam that rewards hardworkers is better for society. What I rue? THe "JEE coaching" industry breeds prestige-chasers who often end up in roles that negatively affect society. It squashes both contrarian and critical thinking skills, rewards rote memorisation and leaves a mental toll on a huge number of teenagers every year.

## What are better signals of intelligence?
- 


<!-- ## Points I want to add
olympiads - possibly smarter - still can be gamed
Smart people are everywhere, not just at IITs. Finding them is hard.
Jamwal
JEE might be an antisignal to intellect. It is a good signal for ?? (people who like science?)
Might be a signal for some base level of intelligence
There's a difference between skill level and intellect
Do I recommend this path? No if you're only goal is getting into IITs. I am just telling you its possible so that those of you who are smart but don't want to slog. Bewarned though. If you are smart enough, slogging will essentially guarantee you qualifying. Concepts is riskier
List books which you used (Jerry march, etc.)
It is true that obsession gets you in. Obsess over practice or concepts - your choice. In today's day and age, LLMs should allow you to choose the concepts path.
Here is my exact score and paper for proof

## About JEE
This is the entrance examination for IITs (a group of the top engineering schools in India) and is colloqially considered the hardest high school examination in the world. ~1.5 million kids write it every year, with only the top 10,000 qualifying.

## Misconceptions
- Qualifying JEE requires high intellect
- JEE is a difficult exam to prepare for


##  

Anyone, regardless of intelligence (above a baseline) would qualify if they did this. It becomes a test of grit, not intelligence. The reward of this path is the ability to work hard on anything + decent analytical skills. The entire coaching industry is built around this system. It's the biggest complaint against JEE - "It only tests memorisation and not conceptual understanding"

However, a lot of the people I mentioned above didn't memorise their way through. For example, I found JEE to be super easy. I studied for only one year, not those crazy hours, and would have practiced ~1K questions in total. I got a rank of 1505 (common rank list).  

Among my 1k batchmates, here are my estimates:
- ~10 people without coaching / only understanding concepts
- ~30 people who took the "best of both worlds approach"
- Rest through memorisation.

### How to score high without studying that much?


## Why am I writing this? 
IITs are viewed as a ticket out of socioeconomic backwardness because the media hypes up the relatively high salaries recieved by graduates. There's a massive industry set up around qualifying it. A section of media revveres people who qualify. Another section considers them trash memorisers.   

From intelligence blog
How is this related to JEE? Its a common misconception that scoring high in this exam implies you are smart. I disagree. Scoring high can be done in 2 ways: (1) A lot of time & effort memorizing an insane amount of problems or (2) understanding the theory in depth and solving a few problems. The JEE coaching industry is a system built around the former. Intelligence doesn't really matter for this (though it helps). 

 Almost anyone can do the former. Its Close to 99% of those who score high fall into the former category.
