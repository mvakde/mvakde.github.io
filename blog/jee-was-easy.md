Misconceptions about JEE and why I found it easy. 

## Points I want to add
Most people in IITs aren't smart / IIT people aren't the smartest
They have a high skill level in one particular domain: JEE/high school analytic tests
olympiads - possibly smarter - still can be gamed
the adage that when a measure becomes a goal, it stops becoming a good measure
Smart people are everywhere, not just at IITs. Finding them is hard.
Jamwal
JEE might be an antisignal to intellect. It is a good signal for ?? (people who like science?)
Might be a signal for some base level of intelligence
There's a difference between skill level and intellect
Do I recommend this path? No if you're only goal is getting into IITs. I am just telling you its possible so that those of you who are smart but don't want to slog. Bewarned though. If you are smart enough, slogging will essentially guarantee you qualifying. Concepts is riskier
List books which you used (Jerry march, etc.)
It is true that obsession gets you in. Obsess over practice or concepts - your choice. In today's day and age, LLMs should allow you to choose the concepts path.

## About JEE
This is the entrance examination for IITs (a group of the top engineering schools in India) and is colloqially considered the hardest high school examination in the world. ~1.5 million kids write it every year, with only the top 10,000 qualifying.

## Misconceptions
- JEE is a hard exam

## How do people generally clear JEE? 
1. Spend 2-6 years studying for this exam. Study 10+ hours a day
2. Memorise a massive list of formulae (phy, math, some chem) and a massive list of facts (chem)
3. Practice an insane number of questions (30K+ or sometimes even higher than that) to the point of memorising question types.  

Anyone, regardless of intelligence (above a baseline) would qualify if they did this. It becomes a test of grit, not intelligence. The reward of this path is the ability to work hard on anything + decent analytical skills. The entire coaching industry is built around this system. It's the biggest complaint against JEE - "It only tests memorisation and not conceptual understanding"

However, a lot of the people I mentioned above didn't memorise their way through. For example, I found JEE to be super easy. I studied for only one year, not those crazy hours, and would have practiced ~1K questions in total. I got a rank of 1505 (common rank list).  

Among my 1k batchmates, here are my estimates:
- ~10 people without coaching / only understanding concepts
- ~30 people who took the "best of both worlds approach"
- Rest through memorisation.

### How to score high without studying that much?
- Understand the concepts deeply, and practice 10-20 difficult questions per chapter. That's all I did. This is enough for all of Physics, most of Maths and third of chemistry. Skip the rest. (I skipped all the memorisation heavy stuff - inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry and integration).  
- To understand the concepts, I had a book where I broke down each and every concept. I didn't memorise any formulae, but I could derive every one of them.
- This should be enough for a ~600 or lower rank in 2025 (In my year, it would have been enough for ~300 rank. I made a bunch of silly mistakes that landed me 1500)
- If you want to get something like ~100 or below, you'd have to take the "best of both worlds" approach. Memorise the rest of chemistry and practice a decent amount of questions for a few topics like integration in Maths. 

## Why am I writing this? 
IITs are viewed as a ticket out of socioeconomic backwardness because the media hypes up the relatively high salaries recieved by graduates. There's a massive industry set up around qualifying it. A section of media revveres people who qualify. Another section considers them trash memorisers.
