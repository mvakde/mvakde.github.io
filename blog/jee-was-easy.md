# Jee was easy
Anecdotes about intelligence, and my experience with JEE. (There's some boasting here, apologies in advance)

## About Intelligence
The smartest people I know personally have 1 characteristic trait -> They can pick up new skills extremely fast, even in domains they had no previous exposure too. I think this is the defining characteristic of intelligence, and it matches F. Chollet's and Suchir Balaji's definitions. There are some other common patterns I want to point out too.

Examples of people I know:
1) Crazy off-the-charts athletic intelligence + academically skilled
    - An undergrad from IISc, who's now doing physics research in Germany. Obviously academically skilled. We met in Paris during our internship
    - Brilliant tennis player. Could have built a career playing the sport
    - One time in high school, he took part in the soccer camp for the *state* (or national I forget) level football team. Fun part - HE HAD NEVER PLAYED SOCCER BEFORE! He learnt to play soccer _during the camp_ and almost made the team!! Anyone who's played a sport competitively know that massive skill differences in each level of the sport. This is a feat beyond comprehension.
    - Recently, we played basketball together. I was teaching him some of the basics of play. In the course of 1 hour, he started playing _way_ better than me. (And I am pretty decent at sports myself)
2) Academically intelligent + brilliant at dance/filmaking
    - IITB batchmate, top of our class. Academically brilliant and super quick at grokking new concepts.
    - Qualified JEE without coaching
    - Is also extremely talented at dancing, filmaking and other arts. Learnt all super quick
    - Decided to drop a promising research career in favor of filmmaking
3) Academics/research/startup
    - IITB batchmate. Started tech teams and ended up guiding seniors in these teams. Graduated top of his class and took on leadership roles. Groks everything superfast 
    - Now building a robot company is SF
4) Academics/tech/startup
    - IITB batchmate.
    - Qualified JEE and AIIMS/NEET (In fact, had a better NEET rank than JEE). Aces both these exams isn't possible unless h
    - Got heavily into coding. Built a startup in college and raised $300K. Working on another startup
3) Academics/research
    - IITB batchmate. Qualified JEE without coaching. Took a risky research path in college, which payed off handsomely. 
    - Is now trying to startup
6) Me
    - Qualified JEE without studying much or solving many problems (AIR 1500 common rank list)
    - Solved my own health problems by reading medical literature
    - I grok concepts in any domain pretty fast. Ended up pretty good at some domains (dance, drums, volleyball, public speaking, MUNs, etc.)
    - Want to startup

So yeah guysing grok concepts super fast in any domain. Other things in common - Taking risky paths in life, willing to stand out, skills in different fields, etc.

## About JEE
I found JEE (Advanced) to be super easy. I got a 1505 rank (common rank list) without studying much or practicing much. Among the 1k IITB batchmates of mine, I estimate there were only ~10 other people in my batch who cpuld boast the same. Why?

How do people generally clear JEE? 
1) Spend 2-6 years studying for this exam
2) Study 10+ hours a day
3) Practice an insane number of questions (10K or sometimes higher than that)

Anyone, regardless of intelligence (above a baseline) would qualify if they did this. It becomes a test of grit, not intelligence. You
