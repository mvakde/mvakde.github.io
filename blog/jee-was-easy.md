Anecdotes about intelligence, and my experience with JEE.

## Intelligence
IMO intelligence is a measure of how little data you need to pick up a new skill. It is NOT the level of your capabilities. The smartest people I know have different capabilities in different domains, but the common thread is that they pick up new skills fast.  

<!-- How is this related to JEE? Its a common misconception that scoring high in this exam implies you are smart. I disagree. Scoring high can be done in 2 ways: (1) A lot of time & effort memorizing an insane amount of problems or (2) understanding the theory in depth and solving a few problems. The JEE coaching industry is a system built around the former. Intelligence doesn't really matter for this (though it helps). 

 Almost anyone can do the former. Its Close to 99% of those who score high fall into the former category.  -->

### The smartest people I know:  
1. **Friend from IISc with off-the-charts athletic intelligence**
    - Acadmically brilliant. He's now doing physics research in Germany. Also a brilliant tennis player. Could have built a career playing the sport
    - One time in high school, he took part in the soccer camp for the *state* level football team. Fun part - <kbd> He had NEVER played soccer before!</kbd> He learnt to play soccer _during the camp_ and almost made the team!! Anyone who's played a sport competitively knows that massive skill differences exist in each level of the sport. This rapid increase in skill is beyond comprehension.
    - Few months ago, we played basketball together. I was teaching him some of the basics of play. In the course of 1 hour, it went from me being able to score easily to him playing _way_ better than me. (And I am pretty decent at sports myself)  
2. **Classmate at IITB: JEE without coaching + brilliant artist**
    - IITB batchmate, top of our class and super quick at grokking new concepts.
    - Qualified JEE without coaching
    - Is also extremely talented at dancing, filmaking and other arts. Learns anything new here extremely quickly
    - Decided to drop a promising research career in favor of filmmaking
3. **Batchmate at IITB: Academics + research + startup**
    - Started tech teams and ended up guiding seniors for projects. 
    - Graduated top of his class, groks everything superfast  and took on leadership roles. 
    - Now building a robot company is SF
4. **Batchmate at IITB:  High scrores on JEE and AIIMS + technically brilliant**
    - Qualified JEE and AIIMS/NEET (he had a better NEET rank than JEE). Studying for both these exams at the same time is crazy
    - Got heavily into coding. Built a startup in college and raised $300K. Working on another startup
5. **Batchmate at IITB: JEE without coaching + research brilliance**
    - Qualified JEE without coaching. Took a risky research path in college, which payed off handsomely. 
    - Is now trying to startup
6. **Me**
    - Qualified JEE with a great score without studying much or solving many problems (AIR 1505 common rank list)
    - Solved my own health problems by reading medical literature
    - I grok concepts in any domain pretty fast. Ended up pretty good at some domains (dance, drums, volleyball, public speaking, MUNs, etc.)
    - Trying to startup

So main thing in common - grokking concepts super fast in any domain, not requiring the same resources as others for similiar feats. Other things in common - Taking risky paths in life, willing to stand out, talented in multiple domains, getting bored easily, etc.

## About JEE
Intelligence is not correlated with your JEE rank. Intelligence is correlated with your rank when taking into account the effort put in.

### How do people generally clear JEE? 
1. Spend 2-6 years studying for this exam. Study 10+ hours a day
2. Memorise a massive list of formulae (phy,math) and memorise 
3. Practice an insane number of questions (30K+ or sometimes even higher than that) to the point of memorising question types.  

Anyone, regardless of intelligence (above a baseline) would qualify if they did this. It becomes a test of grit, not intelligence. The reward of this path is the ability to work hard on anything + decent analytical skills. The entire coaching industry is built around this system. It's the biggest complaint against JEE - "It only tests memorisation and not conceptual understanding"

However, a lot of the people I mentioned above didn't memorise their way through. For example, I found JEE to be super easy. I studied for only one year, not those crazy hours, and would have practiced ~1K questions in total. I got a rank of 1505 (common rank list).  

Among my 1k batchmates, here are my estimates:
- ~10 people without coaching / only understanding concepts
- ~30 people who took the "best of both worlds approach"
- Rest through memorisation.

### How to score high without studying that much?
- Understand the concepts deeply, and practice 10-20 difficult questions per chapter. That's all I did. This is enough for all of Physics, most of Maths and third of chemistry. Skip the rest. (I skipped all the memorisation heavy stuff - inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry and integration).  
- To understand the concepts, I had a book where I broke down each and every concept. I didn't memorise any formulae, but I could derive every one of them.
- This should be enough for a ~600 or lower rank in 2025 (In my year, it would have been enough for ~300 rank. I made a bunch of silly mistakes that landed me 1500)
- If you want to get something like ~100 or below, you'd have to take the "best of both worlds" approach. Memorise the rest of chemistry and practice a decent amount of questions for a few topics like integration in Maths.
