<!-- Anecdotes about intelligence. ADD JAMWAL. REMOVE EVERYONE OTHER THAN TICKU

## Intelligence
IMO intelligence is a measure of how little data you need to pick up a new skill. It is NOT the level of your capabilities. The smartest people I know have different capabilities in different domains, but the common thread is that they pick up new skills fast.  

<!-- How is this related to JEE? Its a common misconception that scoring high in this exam implies you are smart. I disagree. Scoring high can be done in 2 ways: (1) A lot of time & effort memorizing an insane amount of problems or (2) understanding the theory in depth and solving a few problems. The JEE coaching industry is a system built around the former. Intelligence doesn't really matter for this (though it helps). 

 Almost anyone can do the former. Its Close to 99% of those who score high fall into the former category.  -->

### The smartest people I know:  
1. **Friend from IISc with off-the-charts athletic intelligence**
    - Academically brilliant. He's now doing physics research in Germany. Also a brilliant tennis player. Could have built a career playing the sport
    - One time in high school, he took part in the soccer camp for the *state* level football team. Fun part - <kbd> He had NEVER played soccer before!</kbd> He learnt to play soccer _during the camp_ and almost made the team!! Anyone who's played a sport competitively knows that massive skill differences exist in each level of the sport. This rapid increase in skill is beyond comprehension.
    - Few months ago, we played basketball together. I was teaching him some of the basics of play. In the course of 1 hour, it went from me being able to score easily to him playing _way_ better than me. (And I am pretty decent at sports myself)  
2. **Classmate at IITB: JEE without coaching + brilliant artist**
    - Top of our class and super quick at grokking new concepts.
    - Qualified JEE without coaching
    - Is also extremely talented at dancing, filmaking and other arts. Learns anything new here extremely quickly
    - Decided to drop a promising research career in favor of filmmaking
3. **Batchmate at IITB: Academics + research + startup**
    - Started tech teams and ended up guiding seniors for projects. 
    - Graduated top of his class, groks everything superfast and took on leadership roles. 
    - Now building a robot company is SF
4. **Batchmate at IITB:  High scrores on JEE and AIIMS + technically brilliant**
    - Qualified JEE and AIIMS/NEET (he had a better NEET rank than JEE). Studying for both these exams at the same time is crazy
    - Got heavily into coding. Built a startup in college and raised $300K. Working on another startup
5. **Batchmate at IITB: JEE without coaching + research brilliance**
    - Qualified JEE without coaching. Took a risky research path in college, which paid off handsomely. 
    - Is now trying to startup
6. **Me**
    - Qualified JEE with a great score without studying much or solving many problems (AIR 1505 common rank list)
    - Solved my own health problems by reading medical literature
    - I grok concepts in any domain pretty fast. Ended up pretty good at some domains (dance, drums, volleyball, public speaking, MUNs, etc.)
    - Trying to startup

So main thing in common - grokking concepts super fast in any domain, not requiring the same resources as others for similiar feats. Other things in common - Taking risky paths in life, willing to stand out, talented in multiple domains, getting bored easily, etc. -->
