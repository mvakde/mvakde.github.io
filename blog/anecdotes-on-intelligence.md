I've met a lot of smart people in my life. Here are some interesting stories and what I find common amongst them.  

#### The athletic anomaly
Pranav's an IISc grad who chose physics over a tennis career and is currently doing research in Germany.
- In high school, he took part in the selection camp for the state football team as a joke (he had never played soccer before). He learnt to play ==_during the camp_ and almost made the team== (!!)
- I was teaching him the basics of basketball a few months ago. Within an hour, it went from me running circles around him to him playing way better than me.

#### The Tata Titan
Mr Jamwal heads Tata Industries Limited (the venture arm of Tata). I interned there couple of summers ago.
- As a side project, they asked me to teach them some basics of Quantum Mechanics as they were interested in Quantum computing. Its a difficult subject and I didn't expect anyone to actually understand everything
- Somehow, Mr Jamwal was able to keep up during all the sessions. He pretty much understood everything I threw at him and asked brilliant questions. He would have honestly done better than most physics freshmen at IITB despite being busy running a company (I would know, I was a TA for a year)

## Intelligence
IMO intelligence is a measure of how little data you need to pick up a new skill. It is NOT the level of your capabilities. The smartest people I know have different capabilities in different domains, but the common thread is that they pick up new skills fast.  

Anyone who's played a sport competitively knows how high the skill difference is between every level of play (new → casual → school → city → state → national). Pranav's jump from new to state level is a ridiculous feat if you think about it.  

Other common things I've noticed amongst such folks (not sure why though):
- being talented in multiple domains
- taking riskier paths in life
- getting bored easily
- willing to stand out
- high curiosity / question everything
- cannot stand mediocrity or grift
- extremely high agency
