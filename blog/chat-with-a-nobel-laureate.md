(In retrospect, this should have been a tweet)  

I met Mike Kosterlitz when he gave a lecture in Paris. He talked about topological phase transitions and rock climbing. Post the talk, he hung around for a while for snacks. Lucky for me, a lot of the profs already had a chat with him before and most of the students were scared to approach him.

So I went and asked him about his nobel prize winning work, his climbing hobbies and his view on contemporary physics. I don't remember most of the conversation, but this one thing is seared into memory. He something like "I was too stupid to know that the path was a wrong one". His group wasn't as well read as other scientists in the field. So they didn't know that the approach was the "wrong" one. They followed the thread anyway. Got a Nobel prize out of it.
