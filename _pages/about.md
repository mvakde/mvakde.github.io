Hi there! I'm Mithil. I graduated from IIT Bombay with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics.  

What I am doing now:
 - Tackling an AI research problem
 - Hoping to spin this into a company

<!-- Contact me if you want to:
- Collaborate on research ideas -->
<!-- - Fund my startup -->
<!-- - Date me  -->

<!-- Other blogs to know more about me
- My failures 
(cancelling 3 research projects, depression, foray into placements/non-tech )
- (Some of) the craziest things I did
- My Paris trip
- Hobbies -->
  

A few claims to fame:  
 - Biohacked my way out of a chronic disease  
 - Saved my own life during a medical emergency  
 - Qualified JEE without really studying (decent score and rank)

<!-- Currently, I'm building a product based on the principles of Neuromorphic Computing.   -->
<!-- I have a couple of job offers (a corporate venture role & an engineering role), but I'm looking to work at a startup instead.  -->

<!-- I've interned at the new ventures arm of the Tata Group & at UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay. I've also cofounded a startup & won a grant. Find my [**Resume/CV**](/cv) here.  -->


## Fun things I've done over the years
 - I have danced and exchanged life stories with some of Europe's most famous dancers after befriending them on a solo trip to the French Alps.  
 > **How it happened**: *while tavelling to Chamonix, I missed a connecting train and subsequently got stuck in a random French city at midnight without a room. The next train was only at 8am so I began exploring the city and ran into them at a famous tourist site. They were nice enough to give me company till my train the next morning.*   
 - I've had a fun 1-on-1 discussion with a Nobel Laureate about life & hobbies after approaching him with a playful wisecrack about his presentation  
 - I (accidentally) deleted the employee database of Infosys (the Indian IT giant) during a summer camp there.  
 > Luckily, it was a non-production database. I was forgiven because we shouldn't have had such access in the first place (also because they didn't want to discourage an excited kid like me from learning computer science)  
 - I've built a great rapport with the ex-CEO of one of India's largest companies (currently he sits on the board of directors) after cold mailing him. I now often ring him up for advice  


<!-- ## In my past:
- Finished my Bachelor's thesis a sem early in the field Photonics at the Laboratory of Optics of Quantum Materials (LOQM), IITB  
- Undergraduate Research in the field of Neuromorphic Circuits and Algorithms at the Memory Logic Device & Design labs, IIT Bombay  
- Worked as a Jr. Machine Learning Engineer at UMIC. Designed the entire ML & Perceptions subsystem of an aerial robot and qualified 2 stages of the Barcelona Smart Drone Challenge (later cancelled due to COVID-19). The subsystem was co-opted by later recruits, and was used in the aerial robot that won a [**world championship**](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/simulation_challenge.php).
- Served as the coordinator of the aerial robotics team - AeRoVe. During my tenure, I designed a pitch that won INR 0.8 Million in funding through IRCC.
- Qualified the Indian National Astronomy Olympiad. I was invited to the selection camp for the Indian delegation to the International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics
- Runner up at the IBM Bluemix Hackathon during high school (beating teams 2 years senior). I had developed a twitter monitoring tool using Watson's NLU API
- Twice Was as a Teaching Assistant for the Quantum Physics courses (Mandatory courses for all B.Tech Freshmen).   -->

## My hobbies and other interests:
I am an avid dancer. I have won prizes at prestigious dance competitions all over the country (IIT Madras, IIM Calcutta, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Bombay) as a part of the institute dance team.  

I love being on stage (that's why I picked up dancing :P) and I have hosted a live concert of the National Film Award winner, Rekha Bharadwaj, in front of a crowd of 2000 people during Mood Indigo 2019.  

Apart from these, I play the drums and dabble in card magic during my free time. I also like to play volleyball and was a part of my high school volleyball team
