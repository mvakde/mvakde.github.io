Hi there! I'm Mithil.  
I graduated from IIT Bombay with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics.  
I'm a builder at [LossFunk](https://lossfunk.com/) where I am trying to crack [ARC-AGI](http://arcprize.org/) and spin the result into a company.

Here's my [blog](/blog/)  

Here's some cool/stupid shit I've done:
- Biohacked my way out of a chronic disease  
- Saved my own life during a medical emergency 
- Got stuck solo in a random French city at midnight without a room 
  - Greatest night of my life
- Slid down a slope in the swiss alps taking a shortcut on a trek
- Ended up in Italy accidentally due to altitude sickness (unrelated to above)
- Cracked JEE in an extremely unconventional manner
- Accidentally deleted an employee database of Infosys as a kid

I casually play soccer/badminton/snooker/squash/the drums.  
HMU if you're playing in blr - always up for a game or for jamming
