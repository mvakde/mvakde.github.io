Hi there! I'm Mithil. I am a third year undergrad at IIT Bombay. I'm majoring in Engineering Physics, with a minor in Mathematics.  

I'm currently looking for a research internship this summer.  

## Specific Research Interests:
 - I am currently learning **Condensed Matter Physics** and I find the topic to be very interesting
 - Among the topics I have studied during the last 2 years, I have enjoyed **Quantum Optics** and **Neuromorphic Systems & Engineering**    
 - I also wish to explore more fields in Theoretical Physics / Computer Science during my upcoming final year and when I apply for a Master's program  

## Stuff I'm working on:
- Working on my bachelor's project this semester (which is 1 sem early) in the field of nanophotonics and quantum materials  
- Undergraduate Research in the field of Neuromorphic Circuits and Algorithms at the Memory Logic Device & Design labs, IIT Bombay  
- Working as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the PH 107 Quantum Physics and Applications course at IIT Bombay.  
- Serving as an Institute Student Mentor (one of the few juniors selected in a team of 120 seniors), and a Department Academic Mentor (guiding students who are currently in Academic Probation) under the SMP program.

## In my past:
- Worked as a Jr. Machine Learning Engineer at UMIC. Designed the entire ML & Perceptions subsystem of an aerial robot and qualified 2 stages of the Barcelona Smart Drone Challenge (later cancelled due to COVID-19). The subsystem was co-opted by later recruits, and was used in the aerial robot that won a [**world championship**](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/simulation_challenge.php).
- Served as the coordinator of the aerial robotics team - AeRoVe. During my tenure, I designed a pitch that won INR 0.8 Million in funding through IRCC.
- Qualified the Indian National Astronomy Olympiad. I was invited to the selection camp for the Indian delegation to the International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics
- Runner up at the IBM Bluemix Hackathon during high school (beating teams 2 years senior). I had developed a twitter monitoring tool using Watson's NLU API


## My hobbies and other interests:
I am an avid dancer. I have won prizes at prestigious dance competitions all over the country (IIM Calcutta, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Bombay) as a part of the institute dance team.  

I also love being on stage (that's why I picked up dancing :p) and I have hosted a live concert of the National Film Award winner, Rekha Bharadwaj, in front of a crowd of 2000 people during Mood Indigo 2019.  

I also like to play volleyball and was a part of my high school volleyball team
