Hi, I'm Mithil.  

I graduated from IIT Bombay with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics. 

I am trying to crack [ARC-AGI](http://arcprize.org/) and spin the result into a company.  

I started this project as a part of the (now defunct) deeptech accelerator program at [LossFunk](https://lossfunk.com/)

Here's my [blog](/blog/)  

Here's some cool shit I've done:
- Team India selection camp for the Astronomy Olympiad without studying
- Cracked JEE in an [extremely unconventional manner](./blog/jee-is-easy)
- Biohacked my way out of a misdiagnosed health condition 
- Saved my own life during a medical emergency 
    - My arms ballooned ridiculously after a bad gym session. I had learnt enough medicine during the biohacking to know it was rhabdomyolysis.
    - I remembered that confirmation requires a blood test that measures CPK values. Went to the lab, ordered one - my values were 200x the upper limit (diagnostic confirmation + requires immediate hospitalisation levels)
    - Went to the ER with my report and swollen arms. Doctor hadn't heard of rhabdo (the avg doctor is terrible at their job. always go to the best). She refused, saying "go home, nothing to worry about. We'll repeat it tomorrow". Called a second ER - same response.
    - I freaked out, knew I could lose my kidneys if I didn't get treatment
    - I immediately began drinking massive amounts of ORS as a proxy for saline to protect kidneys till I figure something out. But I knew I needed hospitalisation *immediately*
    - So i faked a heart attack (Logic: CPK values go ridiculously high during any muscle cell death scenario, including heart attacks, so I went to the cardiac emergency room, lied about chest pain and showed them this report)
    - They admitted me immediately but turned out the cardio didn't know about rhabdo either! (yeah fml, next time only go to the best docs)
    - So I fought with them for a few hours, saying "screw the heart attack, call a nephro". They finally relented and rang him at 3am. He told them over call that I'm right and its obviously rhabdo, and gave the correct treatment plan
    - The nephro (who came the next day) said he didn't like my actions but it saved my kidneys, and probably my life. 

Stupid/fun shit:
- Got stuck solo in a random French city at midnight without a room 
  - Greatest night of my life
- Slid down a slope in the swiss alps taking a shortcut on a trek
- Ended up in Italy accidentally due to altitude sickness (unrelated to above)
- Accidentally deleted an employee database of Infosys as a kid
