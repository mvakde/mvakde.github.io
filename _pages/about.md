Hi there! I'm Mithil. I recently graduated from IIT Bombay with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics.  
Currently, I'm building a startup based on the principles of Neuromorphic Computing.  
My interests lie in the intersection of AI, Physics and Biology.  
You can find my [**Resume/CV**](/cv) here.  

## Fun things I've done over the years
I love meeting people and this has put me in many fun situations over the years:
 - I have danced along with, and been invited to socialize with some of Europe's most famous dancers after running into them at Annecy, France. This happened because I missed a connecting train to Switzerland and got stuck in the city at midnight without a room. The next earliest train was at 8am in the morning.  
 - I've had a fun 1-on-1 discussion with a Nobel Laureate about life, hobbies after approaching him with playful wisecrack about his presentation  
 - I've built a great rapport with the ex-CEO (currently he sits on the board of directors) of one of India's largest companies after cold mailing him. I now often ring him up for advice  
 - I've (accidentally) deleted the employee database of Infosys (an IT giant in India), during a summer camp there in high school. (I blame our mentor for giving us full access. Luckily they had a backup. Also, I was a kid)  

## Interns/Entreprenuership
I cofounded a startup earlier this year which won a grant of INR 50K. The company is now being run by my colleagues after a pivot. I interned in Paris at the University of Paris-Saclay last summer. This year I interned at Tata Industries, the new Ventures Arm of the Tata Group.

## In my past:
- Finished my Bachelor's thesis a sem early in the field Photonics at the Laboratory of Optics of Quantum Materials (LOQM), IITB  
- Undergraduate Research in the field of Neuromorphic Circuits and Algorithms at the Memory Logic Device & Design labs, IIT Bombay  
- Worked as a Jr. Machine Learning Engineer at UMIC. Designed the entire ML & Perceptions subsystem of an aerial robot and qualified 2 stages of the Barcelona Smart Drone Challenge (later cancelled due to COVID-19). The subsystem was co-opted by later recruits, and was used in the aerial robot that won a [**world championship**](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/simulation_challenge.php).
- Served as the coordinator of the aerial robotics team - AeRoVe. During my tenure, I designed a pitch that won INR 0.8 Million in funding through IRCC.
- Qualified the Indian National Astronomy Olympiad. I was invited to the selection camp for the Indian delegation to the International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics
- Runner up at the IBM Bluemix Hackathon during high school (beating teams 2 years senior). I had developed a twitter monitoring tool using Watson's NLU API
- Twice Was as a Teaching Assistant for the Quantum Physics courses (Mandatory courses for all B.Tech Freshmen).  


## My hobbies and other interests:
I am an avid dancer. I have won prizes at prestigious dance competitions all over the country (IIT Madras, IIM Calcutta, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Bombay) as a part of the institute dance team.  

I love being on stage (that's why I picked up dancing :p) and I have hosted a live concert of the National Film Award winner, Rekha Bharadwaj, in front of a crowd of 2000 people during Mood Indigo 2019.  

Apart from these, I occasionally play the drums and dabble in card magic during my free time. I also like to play volleyball and was a part of my high school volleyball team
