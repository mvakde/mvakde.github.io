Hi, I'm Mithil.  

I graduated from IIT Bombay with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics.  

I'm a builder at [LossFunk](https://lossfunk.com/) where I am trying to crack [ARC-AGI](http://arcprize.org/) and spin the result into a company.

Here's my [blog](/blog/)  

Here's some cool shit I've done:
- Team India selection camp for the Astronomy Olympiad without studying
- Cracked JEE in an [extremely unconventional manner](./blog/jee-is-easy)
- Biohacked my way out of a misdiagnosed health condition 
- Saved my own life during a medical emergency 
    - My arms ballooned ridiculously after a bad gym session. I had learnt enough medicine during the biohacking to know it was rhabdomyolysis.
    - Did the CPK blood test on my own to confirm - my values were 200x the upper limit (diagnostic confirmation + immediate hospitalisation levels)
    - ER doctor hadn't heard of rhabdo (Indian doctors are so bad). Said, "go home, we'll see again tomorrow"
    - I freaked out, knew I could lose my kidneys if I wasn't hospitalised immediately
    - So i faked a heart attack (CPK values go ridiculously high during any muscle cell death scenario, including heart attacks, so I went to the cardiac emergency room, lied about chest pain and showed them this report)
    - Turns out, the cardio didn't know about rhabdo either! (yeah fml, never go to an indian doc)
    - So after admission, I fought with them, saying "screw the heart attack, call a nephro". They finally relented and rang him at 3am. He told them over call that I'm right and its obviously rhabdo, and gave the correct treatment plan
    - The nephro (who came the next day) said he didn't like my actions but I probably saved my kidneys

Stupid/fun shit:
- Got stuck solo in a random French city at midnight without a room 
  - Greatest night of my life
- Slid down a slope in the swiss alps taking a shortcut on a trek
- Ended up in Italy accidentally due to altitude sickness (unrelated to above)
- Accidentally deleted an employee database of Infosys as a kid
