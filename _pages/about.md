Hi there! I'm Mithil. I graduated from IIT Bombay with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics. I'm currently a researcher/builder at LossFunk where I am trying to crack ARC-AGI and spin the result into a company.

Here's some cool/stupid shit I've done:
- Biohacked my way out of a chronic disease  
- Saved my own life during a medical emergency 
- Cracked JEE in an extremely unconventional manner
- Got stuck solo in a random French city at midnight without a room 
  - Greatest night of my life
- Slid down a slope in the swiss alps taking a shortcut on a trek
- Ended up in Italy accidentally due to altitude sickness (unrelated)
- Accidentally deleted an employee database of Infosys as a kid

My hobbies are dancing and drumming. I also casually play soccer/badminton/snooker (hmu if you're playing in blr!)
