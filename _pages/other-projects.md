(Need to add : Machine Learning @ UMIC, Research Intern @ Paris, etc.)  
  
Simulating a brain disorder @ MELODE Labs, IITB [Link](/files/Report_Split_Personality_Simulation.pdf)
------
● Novel Idea: Simulated a brain disorder using neuromorphic computing principles   

Bachelor's Thesis @ LOQM, IITB [Link](/files/Bachelor's-Thesis-Mithil.pdf)
------
● Discovered parameters allowing 0% radiation losses in a photonic crystal  

Self-Balancing Arm
------
● Built a self-balancing arm using propellers fed with IMU and potentiometer data   
● Deployed a PID control algorithm with a kalman filter

Optical Character Reader
------
● Built an OCR to scan printed paper powered by a 2D Convoluted NN using Keras  
● Optimized the algorithm using Transfer Learning and data augmentation  
● 90% accuracy: Chars74k dataset; 80% accuracy on printed paper  

Shop Monitor [Link](https://github.com/mvakde/shop-monitors)

● Non-hermitian hamiltonians: Implemented the Abeles’ matrix formalism in python  
● Plotted non-trivial ATRs and CPA laser points  

Chaotic Attractors [Link](/files/Strange-Attractors.pdf)
------
● Calculated multidimensional chaotic trajectories of 5 attractors using Runge-Kutta methods  

Analysis of proton-proton collisions [Link](https://github.com/mvakde/proton-collision-analysis)
------
● Reconfirmed deviations from the expected results of the transverse momentum of emitted particles  
● Analyzed 19 million datapoints (Monte Carlo data of 13 TeV collisions) in CERN’s ROOT  

Quantum Computing Reading Project [Link](/files/Quantum-Computing-Mithil-Vakde.pdf)
------
● Studied the basics of QIC and various quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa, Quantum Fourier
Transform, Grover’s algorithm, and their implementations using quantum gates on Qiskit
