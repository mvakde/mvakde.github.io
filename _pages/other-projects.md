Here is a list of minor projects I did during my time in college.  
My major research can be found in the [**CV**](/cv) page

Parity-Time Symmetry [Link](https://github.com/mvakde/parity-time-symmetry)
------
● Conducted a literature review of non-hermitian hamiltonians in optics and its resulting applications  
● Implemented the Abeles’ matrix formalism in python; plotted non-trivial ATRs and CPA laser points  

Chaotic Attractors [Link](/files/Strange-Attractors.pdf)
------
● Calculated and plotted multidimensional chaotic trajectories of 5 attractors using Runge-Kutta methods  

Analysis of proton-proton collisions [Link](https://github.com/mvakde/proton-collision-analysis)
------
● Reconfirmed deviations from the expected results of the transverse momentum of emitted particles  
● Analyzed 19 million datapoints (Monte Carlo data of 13 TeV collisions from PYTHIA 8) in CERN’s ROOT  

Shop Monitor [Link](https://github.com/mvakde/shop-monitors)
------
● Engineered a 2-in-1 Burglar Alarm and Fire sensor using an Arduino  
● Implemented advanced techniques that modified the Arduino functionality  

Quantum Computing Reading Project [Link](/files/Quantum-Computing-Mithil-Vakde.pdf)
------
● Studied the basics of QIC and various quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa, Quantum Fourier
Transform, Grover’s algorithm, and their implementations using quantum gates on Qiskit  

Self-Balancing Arm
------
● Built a self-balancing arm using propellers fed with IMU and potentiometer data to identify alignment  
● Facilitated smooth and efficient movement by optimizing the mechanical components and tuning the sensors  
● Built a PID control algorithm to deploy on Arduino framework to provide continuously modulated control  

Optical Character Reader
------
● Built a 2D Convoluted NN using Keras to detect and classify alphanumeric text in document-like imagery  
● Optimized the algorithm using various techniques including Transfer Learning and data augmentation  
● Trained the model on an augmented form of the Chars 74K Dataset and achieved accuracy upwards of 90%
