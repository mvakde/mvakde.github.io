A list of guides I have made
<!--more-->
- Crash course in [Machine Learning](../files/ML-Training-Mithil.pdf) tools  
  - This was made to help train new UMIC recruits in the basics of ML. Needless to say, this is not as in-depth as is needed to work on complex projects
- Guide to installing [ROOT on windows](../files/Root_Installation_Guide_for_Windows_WSL.pdf) (including installing WSL)  
  - We needed to work with ROOT for the mandatory data analysis course for EP students. I noticed that most of my peers were struggling due to not having worked with computers in depth before, so I made a guide for absolute beginners to be able to install Windows Subsystem for Linux on their PCs, add graphics capability, and install ROOT itself so that they'll be able to work through the course properly
