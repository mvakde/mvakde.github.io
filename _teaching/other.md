A list of guides I have made
<!--more-->
- Crash course in [Machine Learning](../files/ML-Training-Mithil.pdf) tools  
  - This was made to help train potential UMIC recruits in the basics of ML. This was followed up by multiple assignments and a month long project, mentored by me. I made the timeline very short, expecting them to finish 60-80% of the required tasks. Ideally, this will take a much longer time.
- Guide to installing [ROOT on windows](../files/Root_Installation_Guide_for_Windows_WSL.pdf) (including installing WSL)  
  - We needed to work with ROOT for the mandatory data analysis course for EP students. I noticed that most of my peers were struggling due to not having worked with computers in depth before, so I made a guide for absolute beginners to be able to install Windows Subsystem for Linux on their PCs, add graphics capability, and install ROOT itself so that they'll be able to work through the course properly
