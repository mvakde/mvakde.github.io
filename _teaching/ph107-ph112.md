snip: "**Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (TA), mandatory freshman B.Tech courses**<br>In my fourth year, I was in charge of the ~1500 freshmen & the 40 TAs of the Quantum Mechanics course (PH 112).<br>In my third year, I taught 45 students as a TA for the older version of this course, Quantum Physics & Applications (PH 107)"

**Context**: This page contains the (slightly edited) list of resources I had made for the students taking PH107 back in 2021. Considering the overlap between the syllabi of PH107 and PH112, I've combined the tutorial question and answers for both the courses. I will mention which questions are out of the syllabus during each tutorial class. (The original PH107 resources was a group effort by 4 of us)

## Resources

The official text for the course is **Modern Physics by Serway, Moses and Moyer**. This is a good book for whoever is very new to these concepts. If you are comfortable with the intuition and would like a challenge, then I suggest **Nouredine Zettili's Quantum mechanics: Concepts and Applications**. This book starts from the basics and covers the entirety of non-relativistic quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level. It also has a ton of practice problems and solved examples.
