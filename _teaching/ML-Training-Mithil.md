**A crash course in Machine Learning tools, Innovation Cell (UMIC), a student-run tech team at IIT Bombay**  
I created this to help train potential UMIC recruits in the basics of ML. This was followed up by multiple assignments and a month-long project, mentored by me. I made the timeline very short, expecting them to finish 60-80% of the required tasks. Ideally, this will take a much longer time.
