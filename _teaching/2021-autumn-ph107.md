## Resources

The official text for the course is **Modern Physics by Serway, Moses and Moyer**. This is a good book for whoever is very new to these concepts.  
If you are comfortable with the intuition and would like a challenge, then I suggest **Nouredine Zettili's Quantum mechanics: Concepts and Applications**. This book starts from the basics and covers the entirety of non-relativistic quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level. It also has a ton of practice problems and solved examples.
